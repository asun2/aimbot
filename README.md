# aimbot
Camera tracking program with 2 axis servo

Goals for this mini project:
-- properly setting up of opencv (how hard can it be? xqcL)
-- gitting used to git
-- camera goals
- access the camera
- object detection (maybe with numpy, look into)
-- servo goals
- manual control
-- be able to recognize and track moving objects (don't know what i'm getting into here, but its the aim part of aimbot)
-- recognize an object, store its location based on servo positions, and be able to move the camera to the recalled location
-- gimbal-like stabilization (might be a stretch, only have two axis of movement)
